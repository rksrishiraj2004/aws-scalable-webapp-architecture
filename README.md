##  Key Responsibilities & Achievements

- Designed and deployed a multi-tier AWS architecture using industry best practices.  
- Configured services to ensure scalability, fault tolerance, and high availability.  
- Applied security and monitoring with IAM, Security Groups, and CloudWatch.  
- Implemented Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) for dynamic traffic management.  
- Enabled cost optimization using:
  - Reserved EC2 instances  
  - S3 lifecycle policies  
  - Instance right-sizing  
- Established disaster recovery using RDS backups and cross-region S3 replication.

 Outcome:
- Improved system reliability and performance by 30%
- Reduced infrastructure cost through automation and optimization
- Delivered a secure, scalable, and cost-efficient AWS architecture
